## What I Would like to do if I had more time.
* Use Tanstack/react-query for data fetching (binding fetches to component lifecycle is not ok)
* Work on some animations
* Add a disabled state to the Book an Appointment button in case no date is selected
* Refactor more!!

# Hope you like it most importantly I had fun!!
